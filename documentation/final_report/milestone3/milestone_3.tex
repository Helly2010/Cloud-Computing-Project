\section{Introduction}

LowTech GmbH, a medium-sized enterprise specializing in wooden furniture production, is modernizing its IT infrastructure as part of a comprehensive cloud transformation. Initially relying on traditional on-premises systems, the company faced challenges in scalability, security, and operational efficiency.

The transformation began with a thorough assessment of the existing infrastructure, which revealed the following key challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited scalability due to fixed hardware constraints.
    \item High operational costs and energy consumption of legacy systems.
    \item Outdated security measures, including basic firewall protection.
    \item Lack of automation, requiring manual interventions for maintenance and scaling.
\end{itemize}

To address these challenges, a private cloud migration strategy was adopted. The aim was to improve scalability, security, and cost-efficiency while ensuring minimal downtime and business continuity.
The company transitioned its Webshop as a cloud native application to Microsoft Azure.

\subsection{Overview of the Previous Milestones}

\subsubsection{Starting point}
LowTech GmbH, a small to medium-sized enterprise with 45 employees specializing in wooden furniture production, is facing a critical need for technological transformation.
Initially relying on sales representatives, the company transitioned to an online store a few years ago, which has now become their primary selling platform.
This shift has led to a significant increase in user numbers over the past two years, necessitating a modernization of their IT infrastructure.
The CEO of LowTech GmbH, recognizing the need for modernization, has expressed interest in cloud computing to make the company future-ready.
\subsubsection{Milestone 1:}

The objective of the technological transformation for LowTech GmbH is to modernize its server and application infrastructure by migrating to a private cloud environment.
This initiative aims to create a scalable, secure, and efficient IT framework that aligns with the company's growing needs, particularly in response to increased online sales and user traffic.
By adopting a private cloud strategy, LowTech GmbH will retain control over its data while outsourcing hardware maintenance to a third-party provider.
This transition will involve leveraging newer technologies to enhance performance and availability, ensuring compliance with security standards, and reducing operational costs.
Ultimately, the transformation seeks to provide a future-ready infrastructure that supports the company's evolving business model and operational requirements.
\paragraph{}
This was our assessment of the original infrastructure:
\subsubsection*{Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fixed Hardware \& Inflexible Infrastructure}:
          Current infrastructure consists of 7 on-premises servers housed in a single 19-inch rack,
          along with 17 clients and 19 laptops all with predetermined, static configurations.
          Moreover, the physical constraints of the on-premises setup, with no additional space for expansion, severely limit scaling options.
          This inflexibility makes it challenging to accommodate growth or adapt to changing business needs.

    \item \textbf{Absence of Resource Utilization/pooling}:
          There's no apparent way to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand or user traffic fluctuation in the current infrastructure.
          Each application typically runs on a dedicated server with fixed resources.
          This approach leads to inefficient resource utilization, as some servers may be underutilized while others are overloaded which may lead to performance issues during peak times or resource waste during low-demand periods due to no dynamic resource allocation.
    \item \textbf{Manual Processes \& High Cost}:
          Any changes in capacity would likely require manual hardware upgrades or replacements including hardware installation,
          and configuration, making the process time-consuming and potentially leading to downtime.
          Replacement of hardware is not only tedious but also financially burdensome due to high costs of new hardware.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Availability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Obsolete Hardware/OS \& Runtime Environments}:
          Many components of the current infrastructure is based on very old hardware and outdated operating systems such as
          Windows XP SP3 (Finance clients), Windows 7 SP3 (HR clients and Customer Service laptops), Debian 5.0 Lenny (Warehouse clients and server),
          Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Sales CRM Storage server) etc. Several applications are running on outdated software versions such as Java 1.7/1.8,
          MySQL 5.5/5.7, PHP 5.3 and Firefox 3.6 etc. which makes this whole infrastructure more susceptible to failure.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Redundancy and Backup Mechanism}:
          There's no mention of redundant systems or data backup solutions which might lead to significant service disruptions as well as data loss in case of any system failure.

    \item \textbf{Manual Maintainance}:
          It is impossible to meet high availability requirements without a robust failover mechanism due to manual maintenance operations.
          This increases the possiblity of human errors, leads to longer downtime and reduces overall reliability.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basic Windows Firewall}:
          It provides minimal outward traffic control, which may allow malware to interact easily.
          Without additional tools, centralized administration is impossible to maintain consistent security rules across all 36 client devices (17 clients and 19 laptops).
          It lacks advanced threat protection features, leaving the system vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
    \item \textbf{pfSense for Network Packet Filtering}:
          There are no built-in antivirus features, which could let malicious payloads get through. Its effectiveness heavily relies on proper configuration, which may be challenging without dedicated IT staff.
          Moreover, advanced intrusion detection requires additional setup and maintenance.

\end{itemize}

As detailed in the analysis the infrastructure was becoming quite expensive and inefficient given the company objectives.

\subsubsection*{Plan and execution based on the original requirements:}

This milestone resulted in a migration and optimization plan for the entire infrastructure:
\begin{itemize}

    \item  Talk with server space providers, we need to stablish a contract and negotiate price and SLOs based on the server requirements
    \item Gather all the installation information, binaries, licenses and documentation for all applications.
    \item Configure a development environment to upload all artifacts such as configuration files and container images.
    \item Create Ansible configuration files for each application, to automate the installation and replication process.
    \item Develop scripts to automate application functionality and load testing. To determine if the configurations will be on par or better than the current infrastructure.
    \item Provision and install the private cloud management software, including the networking configuration
    \item Configure the storage
    \item Create the virtual machines for the base hosts
    \item Configure Prometheus to monitor the virtual machine installations
    \item Establish the network links between the different virtual domains
    \item Install all database servers
    \item Develop a migration process to replicate the current data into the new database servers.
    \item Review that data is up to parity with the legacy services
    \item Create a proxy getaway for the services, so we can redirect the traffic from the old services to the new ones.
    \item Deploy the new applications into the private cloud
    \item Check that the data replication is working
    \item Prepare the load shifting in sequence, and off hours
    \item Shift load in sequence, starting from the most isolated applications first, then the ones with the most dependencies.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Migrate finance and HR, since they are self-contained
              \item Migrate operations
              \item Migrate customer service
              \item Migrate warehouse
              \item Migrate webshop
              \item Migrate sales
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Milestone 2}

Once the client for the project decided to actually migrate to a public cloud service provider, we developed a new strategy.
Given that the Webshop in particular was going to be developed from scratch following modern approaches with new technologies.\\
We proposed a new standard for this kinds of applications:

\subsubsection*{Webshop Infrastructure, Tools, and Services:}

This application will be newly developed following the standard for new applications.
As a special consideration, this application is the only public-facing application that needs to handle customer requests.
Our standard for newly developed applications enables this critical piece of the business to easily scale and be secured with valid certificates with no extra configurations.\\

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Webshop: Website Deployment Strategy}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{General Considerations:}

Importantly, for all newly developed applications, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up a private GitHub repository
    \item Set up GitHub actions to enable continuous integration and continuous deployments in Azure
    \item Set up an infrastructure folder to hold terraform files. These files will define the infrastructure and will allow for easy repeatability
    \item Use Microsoft Entra ID in case of authentication with the organization is needed
    \item Use Docker to package the application with containers that will be deployed in Azure App Service in case of the backend, and Azure Static Web Apps in case of the frontend
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Standard For a Cloud Native Application:}
When developing a cloud-native application Figure \ref{CloudStandard} shows the basic setup to integrate DevOps concepts into our workflow.
The website is going to be developed under this standard.\\

\end{itemize}

\section{Application Design}
\subsection{Architectural Overview}
As requested by the project. This application wil have 3 tiers. The presentation or user interface, the backend or business logic, and the storage tier.
By our plan in milestone II we will deploy each tier in a different azure service tailored for its needs.
Each of the services provides autoscaling features, and load balancing. Ensuring that we are leveraging the elasticity charactersitics of the cloud.

\subsubsection{Presentation-Tier (Frontend) - User Interface (UI)}

It is important to note that the majority of the presentation was forked from https://github.com/DebasmitaMallick/React-e-Commerce-Website.
This allowed our team to focus on backend and cloud deployment tasks. The original project was modified to interact with our backend API,
integrate with payment providers and provide detailed information about products.

\paragraph{Technology Stack}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend Framework: React.js (JavaScript)
    \item State Management: React Context API
    \item Hosting \& Deployment: Azure Static Web Apps
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Functionality Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigation \& Routing
          Users can navigate between different sections of application, such as viewing product lists, accessing product details, and managing their shopping cart. React Router enables seamless client-side navigation.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item React Router Setup
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item React Router (react-router-dom) to handle the routing of different components, allowing users to navigate through pages like the homepage (/), product detail pages (/product/:id), and potentially a shopping cart or checkout page.
                        \item For product detail pages, you're using dynamic routes with product/:id to fetch and display specific product data based on the product’s unique id. For instance:
                        \item When a user clicks on a product in the catalog, the URL changes to something like /product/123, and the ProductDetail component is rendered with data for product 123.
                        \item This is achieved using useNavigate and useParams hooks provided by React Router to capture the dynamic part of the URL.
                    \end{itemize}

              \item Navigation Links
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item On the homepage (Home.js component), displaying a list of products. Each product has an image and name that users can click. When clicked, the app navigates to the product detail page using the navigate(/product/\${prod.id}) function.\\
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
    \item API Communication
          \begin{itemize}
              \item The product data, which includes the list of products with details such as images, names, prices, and categories, is fetched when the homepage or product catalog page loads.
                    This is done using useEffect to trigger an API call and update the state with the fetched data.
              \item API communication in app is responsible for sending and receiving data from the backend server. This includes fetching product data to populate catalog, and creating orders after checkout.
              \item For payment, we use PayPal and Stripe in a sandbox mode. As this is not the final product, we are just testing the actual integration with the providers.
          \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Key Features of the UI}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item UI Components \& Design

                        \item Bootstrap Integration: react-bootstrap is used to style UI components to enable responsive behavior.
                        \item Dark \& Light Theme Support: A theme context (ThemeContextProvider) dynamically adjusts UI styles based on user preference.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}

    \item Product Display \& Interaction

\subsection{Development Process}

For the development of the application, the team created a Trello board. Using a kamban-like approach, we scoped, 
divided, and prioritized all the necesary development and documentation tasks. Internally two teams were formed, frontend and backend.
Each working in a different layer of the webshop. The backend team was also in charge of the data layer just for convenience. 
The most important tasks were to upgrade the existing UI code to fit the new requirements and integrate with the backend, and to actually develop the backend.
Frameworks like FastAPI were chosen due to the flexibility benefits, rapid development, and automatic documentation generation. Which allowed our team members to quickly review the spec and make the integration.
During the development timeline, we scheduled weekly meetings to report progress and address concearns with the development environment.

For example, we encountered issues while running the new `psycopg` libary in asynchronous mode in windows. Which caused some issues while configuring the development environment.
This could have been an oportunity to build a docker image to standardize our development environments, but given the timeline, we decided against it and just changed to `asyncpg` in windows \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Branching Strategy:} \newline
          The project follows a simple main branch strategy where all contributors work directly on the main branch.
          This ensures seamless integration without managing multiple branches. All changes should be committed with meaningful messages.
          Code should be reviewed and tested before pushing to the main branch.
\end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI):}

                    Every code commit triggers an automated build and testing process. This includes:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Running unit tests to validate individual components.
                        \item Performing integration tests to ensure compatibility between different modules.
                        \item Static code analysis for linting and security vulnerabilities.
                    \end{itemize}

              \item \textbf{Continuous Deployment (CD):}

                    Once the CI stage passes successfully, the application is automatically deployed to the appropriate environment. This process includes:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Deploying to a staging environment for final testing.
                        \item Running automated acceptance tests before production deployment.
                        \item Deploying to production with rollback mechanisms in case of failure.
                    \end{itemize}
