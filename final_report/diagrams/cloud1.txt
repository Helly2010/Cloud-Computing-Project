
Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive cloud transformation strategy for LowTech GmbH, developed by consultants from Awesome Cloud AG. Building on previous technical analyses, it outlines a strategic migration plan for the expanded application landscape, incorporating diverse service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The strategy identifies suitable public, private, and hybrid cloud environments to optimize performance and security while detailing operational cost calculations for a selected public cloud service provider. Key considerations include SAP requirements, legacy system maintenance, and leveraging DevOps and Cloud Native approaches for applications like the Webshop. The report critically analyzes the proposed solutions, balancing benefits and challenges, and aligning them with LowTech GmbHâ€™s business objectives. This forward-looking strategy ensures scalability, flexibility, and resilience, positioning the company for sustainable growth and competitive advantage in the digital era.


Overview of the Problem
LowTech GmbH faces critical challenges with its outdated IT infrastructure, which lacks flexibility, scalability, and standardization. The diverse application landscape, including Finance, HR, Operations, Webshop, and Warehouse systems, requires tailored migration strategies. While some applications can be modernized and containerized, others must remain in their current state due to constraints like unavailable source code.

Resource limitations, including a finite budget and workforce, further complicate the transition, necessitating a phased approach to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity. The lack of full elasticity in the new setup, despite virtualization improvements, limits immediate adoption of cloud-native capabilities like serverless computing.

The transformation requires careful planning for data migration, fallback strategies, and post-migration optimization, ensuring LowTech GmbH achieves a scalable, modernized IT environment while balancing costs, risks, and operational demands.




Objective of Migration

The primary objective of the migration is to modernize LowTech GmbH's IT infrastructure to enhance scalability, flexibility, and operational efficiency. By transitioning to a cloud-based environment, the company aims to:

Improve Performance: Migrate applications to optimized environments (public, private, or hybrid cloud) to ensure enhanced performance, reliability, and security.
Enable Standardization: Standardize the software stack and deployment processes to simplify maintenance and updates.
Ensure Business Continuity: Minimize downtime and disruptions during and after the migration through robust contingency and fallback strategies.
Optimize Costs: Implement a cost-effective solution by carefully assessing resource allocation and operational expenses.
Facilitate Modernization: Leverage containerization and virtualization to enable future adoption of cloud-native and advanced technologies.
Support Long-Term Growth: Create a scalable infrastructure capable of adapting to evolving business and technological requirements.
